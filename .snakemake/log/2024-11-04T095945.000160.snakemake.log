Error in rule samtools_sort:
    jobid: 3
    input: mapped_reads/A.bam
    output: sorted_reads/A.bam
    shell:
        samtools sort -T sorted_reads/A -0 bam mapped_reads/A.bam > sorted_reads/A.bam
        (one of the commands exited with non-zero exit code; note that snakemake uses bash strict mode!)

Removing output files of failed job samtools_sort since they might be corrupted:
sorted_reads/A.bam
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
